#Reflection Questions

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I was familiar with Git beforehand. I had some issue with merge conflicts though. I wasn't able to solve my first conflict when I was learning Git. After the GPS, my partner and I were able to solve the merge conflict in our assignment.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

The word 'tracked' is used to refer to files that have been staged/added and not those that are being monitored. Some confusion arose when I said 'tracked files' and it was thought that I was referring to staged files. Now I know that it will be clearer if I say 'monitored files'.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked my partner whether or not he wanted to start navigating or driving. I asked our guide how detailed we had to get in explaining how Git keeps track of changes.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

The idea of rebasing when it comes to merging branches. It is one of the options that they have on Github when it comes to merging. This is a part of Git that I will research on my own.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was a nice experience. It was great to have someone answer questions on what do to do. She was all right when I had created a history.txt file for the commands instead of writing the command history in the README file because she saw that we had understood the concepts and wanted us to move on to other concepts and not get caught in the minute details. She also gave extra information as we progressed. For example, she gave a brief summary of the MIT license when we had to include it.
