**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
 
* I was and still am learning to figure out the logistical work flow of addition of edits to branches. So, the limits and configurations of the new commands i am learning, like PUSH, PULL, FETCH, etc and in what order GIT uses the functions. It's been of matter of familiarizing myself with the thresholds.   That being said, I understand conceptually the nature and purpose of GIT and Github, and I feel engaged in figuring it out piece by piece.



**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

* I'm starting to have more of an understanding about how to work collaboratively remotely. for example: I can see that two people can remotely work on the same branch. Conceptually, I get the whats happening. The clarity for me in this particular exercise is more logistic, than conceptual. Its more about logic and rules, and why git and Github are structured and function the way that they are.



**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

* I remember my last questions pertained to merging conflicts. So I was asking for example: If I create a branch locally, on my laptop, and PUSH it to Github, then can two people simultaneously and remotely create, add, and confirm separate files/documents?


**What still confuses you about Git?**

* The structure and use of the commands.  The formatting of the language. I'm in the process now of familiarization. 


**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

* SO GOOD! I loved it. My guide Celeen was exceptionally kind, clear, empathetic and my partner was very commityed and patient. We worked throughly through our mutual concerns.
